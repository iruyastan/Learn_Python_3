# Your code below: 

#Start by turning this list of customer first names into a list called first_names
first_names = ["Ainsley", "Ben", "Chani", "Depak"]

#Create a list called preferred_size.
preferred_size = ["Small", "Large", "Medium"]

#Depak’s size is "Medium". Use .append() to add "Medium" to the preferred_size list.
preferred_size.append("Medium")

print(preferred_size)

#Create a two-dimensional list called customer_data
customer_data = [["Ainsley", "Small", True], ["Ben", "Large", False], ["Chani", "Medium", True], ["Depak", "Medium", False]]

print(customer_data)

#Change the data value for "Chani"‘s shipping preference to False
customer_data [2][2] = False

print(customer_data)

#"Ben" reached out to Maria asking to remove his shipping option.Use the .remove() method to delete the shipping value from the sublist that contains ben’s data.
customer_data[1].remove(False)

print(customer_data)

#Maria received new customers, "Amit" and "Karim". Create a new variable customer_data_final. Combine our existing list customer_data with our new customer 2d list using + by adding it to the end of customer_data.

customer_data_final = customer_data + [["Amit", "Large", True], ["Karim","X-Large", False ]]
